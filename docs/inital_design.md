# Initial Design

## Requirements
- As a subscriber, I want to get an email at some frequency, so that I can use its content.
- As a maintainer, I want to control how many subscribers exist, so that the app doesn't get overwhelmed
- As a subscriber, I want to customize the content in my feed, so that I am more specifically served.
- As a designer, I want this app to be as simple, modular, and single-responsibility as possible, so that I can reuse it
- As a dev, I want this app to be serverless and probably leverage cloud platforms to serve up the notifications, so that I don't have to maintain much
